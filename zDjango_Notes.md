# Django Course Notes

## Migrations:

- A migration allows you to move databases from one design to another
  - This is also reversible

## Django Project:

- A Django Project is a collection of applications and configurations that, when combined together, will make up the full web application

## Django App:

- A Django Application is created to perform a particular functionality for your entire web application

  - Example: Registration app, polling app, comments app etc.

- These Django Apps can then be plugged into other Django Projects, so you can reuse them
